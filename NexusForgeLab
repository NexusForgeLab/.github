# NexusForgeLab

Forging reliable software at the intersection of infrastructure, automation, and open-source engineering.

## 🚀 What We Build
NexusForgeLab hosts a mix of **open-source** and **private** projects focused on:

- 🐳 Docker & containerized services
- ⚙️ DevOps automation & tooling
- 🧱 Self-hosted infrastructure stacks
- 🛠️ Internal engineering utilities
- 🧪 Experimental and R&D projects

## 🌍 Open-Source First
We believe in:
- Open by default
- Practical engineering over hype
- Tools that run reliably in real-world environments

Public repositories are open for collaboration and contributions.

## 🔒 Private Projects
Some repositories are maintained privately for:
- Internal tooling
- Prototypes
- Client or environment-specific systems

## 🤝 Contributing
Contributions are welcome on all public repositories.

- Open an issue for discussions
- Submit pull requests with clear context
- Keep things simple and maintainable

## 📌 Organization Structure
- **Public repos** → Open-source tools & stacks
- **Private repos** → Internal, experimental, or client work
