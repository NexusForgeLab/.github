### 🚀 What We Build

NexusForgeLab operates as a hybrid engineering hub, maintaining a mix of **open-source** contributions and **private** enterprise tooling. Our primary engineering focus includes:

| Domain | Focus Areas |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🐳 Containers** | Docker composition, container orchestration, and microservices patterns. |
| **⚙️ DevOps** | CI/CD pipelines, automation scripting, and infrastructure-as-code (IaC). |
| **🧱 Self-Hosting** | Robust stacks for home-labs and independent infrastructure. |
| **🛠️ Tooling** | Internal CLI utilities and engineering productivity tools. |
| **🧪 R&D** | Experimental projects pushing the boundaries of reliable automation. |

### 🌍 Our Philosophy: Open First

We believe that software should be practical and transparent. Our core tenets are:

* **Open by default:** Whenever possible, we make our work public to benefit the community.
* **Engineering > Hype:** We prioritize tools that run reliably in real-world environments over the latest trends.
* **Collaboration:** Public repositories are always open for contributions, forks, and improvements.

---

### 📌 Repository Structure

To help you navigate our organization, we categorize our work into two streams:

#### 🔓 Public Repositories
> *Open-source tools, public stacks, and community projects.*
* **Target:** Community use, collaboration, and educational value.
* **License:** Generally MIT or Apache 2.0 unless otherwise stated.

#### 🔒 Private Repositories
> *Internal tooling, client-specific implementations, and active prototypes.*
* **Target:** Internal operations and specific client environments.
* **Note:** These may move to public status once they reach a stable maturity level.

### 🤝 Contributing

We welcome engineers, hobbyists, and automation enthusiasts to contribute to our public work.

1.  **Discuss:** Open an issue to discuss bugs or feature ideas.
2.  **Context:** Submit Pull Requests (PRs) with clear descriptions of *why* the change is needed.
3.  **Simplicity:** We value maintainable, readable code over complex abstractions.
